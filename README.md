Steps for Titanic Survival Prediction using Linear Regression:
Data Preparation:
Dataset: Obtain the Titanic dataset, which is often available in various forms,
such as the one from Kaggle or the Titanic dataset in the Seaborn library.
Preprocessing:
Handle Missing Values: Fill or impute missing values appropriately. 
For instance, you might fill missing age values with the median age or use more advanced imputation methods.
Normalization: Normalize or standardize your features if they vary widely in scale. 
This step can improve the performance of linear models.
Build the Model:
Use a linear regression model to fit the data. 
In most machine learning libraries, linear regression can be instantiated with just a few lines of code.
Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of your model.
Train the linear regression model on the training set.
Evaluation:
Model Output: The linear regression model will output continuous values. 
For prediction purposes, you might need to apply a threshold to classify these predictions into binary outcomes
(e.g., if the predicted probability is greater than 0.5, classify as survived).
Metrics: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics. 
For regression, this might include mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE), but for classification, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are more relevant.
Analysis:
Examine the coefficients to understand the relationship between the features and survival.
However, remember that linear regression may not capture complex patterns as effectively as classification algorithms like logistic regression or decision trees.
